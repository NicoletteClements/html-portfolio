<h1>The Best Movies According to Nicolette</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>
This has been my favourite move since teenage years <br />
A true fairytale with my favourite 2 actors, Richard Gere & Julia Roberts <br />
</p>

<h3>The Other Women</h3>
<p>One of my more recent favourites as it has Cameron Diaz and is a mix of incredible humor, lifes realities, unexpected real friendships and a fairytale ending</p>

<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>
One of my favourite actresses, Sandra Bullock, with an unexpected and unpredictable twist <br />
Especially love the part in the forest where Sandra chants "to the windows, to walls..."
