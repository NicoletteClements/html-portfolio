<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First and foremost, I am a mom of one. A beautiful headstrong 21-year old Aries daughter, who keeps me on my toes at every turn</p>

<p>I started my career in the corporate world, specialising in admin, working my way into finance, then back to admin and back to finance.
  Whilst I've spent most of my career in the corporate world, eventually moving from Finance into Distribution, a high performance, 
  fast-paced, ever changing, dynamic environment, my heart and natural skill has always tugged me towards design.  For most of my career, 
  I would seek any opportunity to explore this skill further, but was never brave enough to make design a full time career
</p>

<p>Eventually in my forties, after doing various academic and leadership studies in the business field, I decided it was time to take my
  curiosity and love for design a step further.  I first invested in a Canon Camera and started exploring with photography, something
  I still love today, specifically macro and nature photography.  I then saw a Web Design course through the University of Cape Town, South Africa
  and decided to try my hand at this skill, which I'd never previously considered.  I absolutely love how it all comes together, the 
  coding, the creativity, the simplicity, the complexity, just everything about it.  It challanges you to the core, but is equally rewarding.
  It's become a passion, which I hope to explore as a full time career into the future
